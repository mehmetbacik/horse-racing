# Horse Racing Trial Day

This project simulates a horse racing event where users can generate a list of horses, schedule races, and view race results. The project is developed using Vue.js (Vue CLI), TypeScript, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP for animations, with unit tests handled by Jest.

## Features

- **Generate Horses:** Users can generate a random list of horses with unique IDs, colors, and conditions.
- **Race Schedule:** The project includes a schedule for 6 races with different distances.
- **Race Simulation:** Races are simulated with animated horses that run sequentially.
- **Results Display:** Results are displayed in order after each race, showing the positions and performance of each horse.
- **Control Buttons:** Includes buttons to generate the program and start/pause the race.
- **Responsive Design:** All components are designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies

- **Vue.js:** A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **SCSS:** A powerful CSS preprocessor for better style organization and maintainability.
- **Vuex:** State management pattern and library for Vue.js applications.
- **GSAP:** A high-performance animation library for creating complex animations.
- **Jest:** A testing framework used for unit testing components and functionality.
